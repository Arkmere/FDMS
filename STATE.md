# STATE.md — Vectair FDMS Lite

Last updated: 2026-02-16 (Europe/London) — Sprint 7 LOC Standard Modal Parity

This file is the shared source of truth for the Manager–Worker workflow:
- **Manager (PM)**: User (coordination, priorities, releases)
- **Solutions Architect & QA Lead**: ChatGPT (task tickets, audits, risk management)
- **Production Engineer**: Claude Code (implements tickets, updates this ledger)

---

#### Delivery model and runtime model (NO DRIFT)
**FDMS Lite is NOT a static web app and NOT a website.**
**FDMS Lite is a standalone desktop application** (Windows + Linux) that uses **web technologies internally** (HTML/CSS/JS UI) for its interface.

During development and QA, we run FDMS Lite via a **local server harness** that serves `src/` (e.g. `python -m http.server`). This is a **development/runtime convenience only** and must not be interpreted as "FDMS is a web product" or "FDMS is intended to be hosted".

**OS targets:** Development is performed on **Windows**. Operational installation/use is on **Linux**. **Both OS are required** and must remain supported.

---

#### Development workflow approved for Release v1
The current workflow (git branches/PRs + local repo checkout + local server harness) is **approved and sufficient to reach Release v1**.

- Day-to-day development occurs in the repo via branches and PRs.
- Local execution uses `run.ps1` / `run.bat` / `run.sh` to serve `src/` and open the UI locally.
- Regression scripts (e.g., Playwright) are **developer QA tooling** only and are **not required for end users**.

---

#### Packaging / installers / auto-update (explicitly out of scope for Release v1)
**Packaging (installers), desktop wrapping, and auto-update mechanisms are out of scope for Release v1 unless explicitly reprioritised.**

Any future update mechanism must be based on **versioned release artifacts** (e.g., GitHub Releases), **not** "pull latest `main` and restart". Do not introduce packaging or auto-update work into v1 sprints unless the project owner explicitly opens that workstream.

---

#### Drift guardrails (do not reinterpret)
- Do **not** describe FDMS Lite as a "static web app", "web app", or "website".
- Do **not** propose "hosting" FDMS as the default delivery path.
- The local server (`python -m http.server`) is a **development harness** to run the desktop UI locally; it is not product hosting.
- Do **not** add packaging/installer/updater scope unless explicitly requested and scheduled as its own epic.

---

#### Why run.* scripts fetch/reset
The `run.*` scripts perform a fetch/reset to a specified branch to ensure the local working copy matches the expected code for testing. This is a **developer convenience** and **not** the intended end-user update mechanism.

---

## 1) System Architecture

### 1.1 Product goal
A lightweight, **standalone desktop application** ("FDMS Lite") for local ATC/ops workflow, using web UI technologies (HTML/CSS/JS) for its interface:
- Live "strip" board (movements)
- Booking workflow that can create planned strips and stay synchronized
- Calendar for bookings and general events
- Admin tooling (profiles, etc.)
- Fully offline / local deployment, using local persistence (localStorage)

### 1.2 Tech stack
- **Standalone desktop application** using web UI technologies (HTML/CSS/JS); run locally via a **local server harness** serving `src/` (not a hosted web product)
- **Module style**: ES modules (`src/js/...`)
- **Persistence**: `localStorage`
- **Data model**: movements ("strips") stored in `src/js/datamodel.js`
- **UI modules**:
  - `src/js/ui_liveboard.js` (Live Board + timeline + history)
  - `src/js/ui_booking.js` (Bookings + calendar + profiles + admin)
- **Services / stores**:
  - `src/js/services/bookingSync.js` (cross-domain consistency + reconciliation)
  - `src/js/stores/bookingsStore.js` (UI-agnostic booking persistence)

### 1.3 Core domain objects (current)
- **Movement (strip)**: persisted via `datamodel.js`
  - Key fields include: `id`, `status` (PLANNED/ACTIVE/COMPLETED/CANCELLED), `dof`, `flightType` (ARR/DEP/LOC), `arrPlanned`, `depPlanned`, `bookingId` (optional link)
- **Booking**: persisted via `bookingsStore.js`
  - Key fields include: `id`, `status`, `linkedStripId` (optional), contact/aircraft fields, `schedule.*`
- **Calendar Event**: general calendar entries (separate from bookings)
- **Booking Profile**: reusable template for autofill

### 1.4 Cross-domain invariants (must always hold)
- If `movement.bookingId = X`, booking `X` must exist or be cleared.
- If `booking.linkedStripId = Y`, movement `Y` must exist or be cleared.
- Prefer deterministic conflict resolution (conservative: clear stale pointers, avoid deleting records).

---

## 2) Implementation Status

### 2.1 Completed (believed stable)
**Bidirectional Calendar ↔ Booking ↔ Strip sync**
- Booking create/update propagates to linked strip(s)
- Strip edit/cancel/complete propagates back to booking fields/status
- Booking cancel/delete supports "cancel linked strip" vs "keep strip" paths

**Booking Profiles (Admin)**
- Create/edit/delete/search profiles
- Booking autofill from profile (then VKB fallback)

**Calendar**
- Month / Week / Year views
- Click-to-edit/delete general calendar events

**Live Board housekeeping**
- EGOW "today" counters (BM/BC/VM/VC) are mutually exclusive
- FIS labels Manual / Strip / Total; Strip FIS is today-only
- Timeline is today-only
- Time-based stale highlights + periodic refresh + auto-activation
- "Past planned time" strips start ACTIVE
- History "Edit > Details" works (no openEditModal error)
- Dropdown menus use portal-based approach to avoid clipping

**Module architecture improvement**
- Removed circular import between `ui_booking.js` and `ui_liveboard.js`
- Introduced:
  - `src/js/services/bookingSync.js`
  - `src/js/stores/bookingsStore.js`

**Booking schedule canonical planned-time**
- Added:
  - `booking.schedule.plannedTimeLocalHHMM`
  - `booking.schedule.plannedTimeKind` (ARR/DEP/LOC)
- Kept:
  - `booking.schedule.arrivalTimeLocalHHMM` for backwards compatibility
- Migration introduced to populate canonical planned time for legacy bookings
- DEP strip updates no longer overwrite `arrivalTimeLocalHHMM`
- Store normalization ensures canonical fields always populated on create/update
- UI form handlers write canonical fields explicitly

**Bidirectional reconciliation + integrity enforcement**
- `bookingSync.reconcileLinks()` fully bidirectional:
  - Clears `movement.bookingId` if booking missing
  - Clears `booking.linkedStripId` if movement missing
  - Repairs `booking.linkedStripId` if single strip claims it (deterministic)
  - Detects conflicts (multiple strips claiming same booking)
- Returns detailed summary: `{ clearedMovementBookingId, clearedBookingLinkedStripId, repairedBookingLinkedStripId, conflicts }`
- Runs before first render (app.js bootstrap)

**No-op patch optimization**
- `updateBookingById()` skips save/dispatch if patch makes no actual changes
- Reduces write churn and event storms

**Non-seeding + persistence**
- Demo seeding should not re-appear
- Persistence across reload is expected for movements/bookings/calendar/profiles

### 2.2 Backlog (known or suspected gaps)
These are not confirmed resolved unless explicitly audited against a fresh zip.

**Event / refresh storm safety**
- ✅ RESOLVED (Sprint 3): Stress-tested under all edge flows (rapid edits, multi-strip, status transitions, booking sync, delete/cancel). No loops or redundant re-renders detected.
- Reentrancy guards in place; no-op optimization added
- Diagnostics instrumentation available via `__FDMS_DIAGNOSTICS__` flag for future regression testing

**UI/UX quality improvements** (non-critical)
- Booking edit form could display flight type explicitly (currently inferred as ARR)
- Reconciliation summary could be logged or displayed to user (currently silent)
- Strip→booking sync could validate more fields (pob, remarks, etc.)

---

## 3) Technical Debt & Risks

### 3.1 Data integrity / drift
- ✅ RESOLVED: Bidirectional reconciliation now enforced
- ✅ RESOLVED: Canonical planned time always populated (migration + normalization + UI)
- Remaining risk: Multi-user concurrent edits not supported (localStorage is single-client)

### 3.2 Event-driven coupling
- ✅ MITIGATED: Reentrancy guards in bookingSync._dispatchBookingPatch
- ✅ MITIGATED: No-op optimization prevents unnecessary save/dispatch cycles
- ✅ VERIFIED (Sprint 3): Stress audit confirmed no event storms under rapid edits, status transitions, booking sync, and delete/cancel flows. Render counts scale 1:1 with user actions.

### 3.3 Schema evolution
- Any schema additions must remain backwards compatible and migrate once, deterministically.
- Migration pattern established: bookingsStore.ensureInitialised() runs once on load

---

## 4) Current Sprint (Immediate Objective)

**Sprint goal:** ✅ COMPLETE - Integrity and schedule-consistency gaps closed and verified.

### 4.1 Completed objective (Sprint 1)
✅ Performed targeted audit/fix:
1) `bookingSync.reconcileLinks()` is fully bidirectional and deterministic.
2) Booking create/edit flows always set `schedule.plannedTimeLocalHHMM` + `schedule.plannedTimeKind`.
3) No-op patches skip write/dispatch (quality improvement implemented).

Exit criteria met:
- ✅ PASS/FAIL checklist with file+function evidence (see commit c0002b2)
- ✅ Orphan pointers repaired on load both directions
- ✅ New/edited bookings always have canonical planned time populated
- ✅ No import cycles; no console errors; persistence works

### 4.3 Hotfix (Admin panel init failure)

Hotfix closed (no further action); verified as part of Sprint 2/3 stability pass.


### 4.2 Sprint 2: Live Board integrity + stats correctness

**Sprint goal:** Fix release-blocking inline edit data-loss bug, add hard-delete for strips, and correct traffic counter logic.

**Verification status:** ✅ VERIFIED in browser (2026-02-09, Chromium 141.0.7390.37, Playwright headless)
- 10/10 tests PASS, 0 JS errors
- State A (clean localStorage) + State B (pre-seeded data) both tested
- Evidence: `Sprint2_Verification_EvidencePack_2026-02-09.md` + `evidence/*.png` (28 screenshots)
- Test harness: `sprint2_verify.mjs`

#### Task A — Fix inline edit data-loss bug (release blocker) ✅

**Root cause:** Multiple defects in `startInlineEdit()` and time field bindings in `renderLiveBoard()`:

1. **Wrong time field names:** Inline edit for time fields used phantom names (`atd`, `etd`, `ata`, `eta`, `act`, `ect`) instead of canonical movement fields (`depActual`, `depPlanned`, `arrActual`, `arrPlanned`). Edits wrote to non-existent properties; display reads from canonical fields, so edits appeared lost.
2. **Blur/Enter double-fire:** Both Enter key handler and blur handler called `saveEdit()` without guard, causing duplicate updates and re-renders per interaction.
3. **No required field validation:** Blanking required fields (e.g. `callsignCode`) set them to `null` without error, destroying data.
4. **Missing booking sync:** `onMovementUpdated()` was not called after inline edit, so linked bookings drifted.
5. **Missing counter updates:** `updateDailyStats()` / `updateFisCounters()` were not called after inline edit.

**Fix (files changed):**
- `src/js/ui_liveboard.js` — `startInlineEdit()` (lines ~239-345):
  - Added `saved` guard flag to prevent double-fire from Enter + blur race
  - Added required field validation (callsignCode): rejects blank with single error toast, reverts UI cell
  - Added `onMovementUpdated()` call for booking sync after save
  - Added `updateDailyStats()` / `updateFisCounters()` calls after save
- `src/js/ui_liveboard.js` — inline edit bindings (lines ~1635-1647):
  - Fixed time field names: `m.depActual ? "depActual" : "depPlanned"` (was `m.atd ? "atd" : "etd"`)
  - Same fix for arrival times and OVR crossing times

**QA test log:**
- Callsign edit: double-click → edit → Enter → single update, no toast storm, value persists after reload
- Registration edit: works, no other fields affected
- Type edit: works, no other fields affected
- Dep/Arr aerodrome edit: works, value persists
- Time edit (dep/arr): writes to correct canonical field, persists after reload
- Blank callsign: rejected with single "Callsign Code cannot be blank" toast, previous value retained
- Escape: reverts without saving
- No console errors

#### Task B — Add "Delete strip" (hard delete) ✅

**Feature:** Added permanent Delete action to strip Edit dropdown in both Live Board and History, distinct from Cancel (soft delete).

**Files changed:**
- `src/js/datamodel.js` — Added `deleteMovement(id)`: removes movement from in-memory array and persists to localStorage
- `src/js/ui_liveboard.js`:
  - Added `performDeleteStrip(movement)` function: confirmation prompt, booking link cleanup, delete, UI refresh
  - Added Delete button HTML + event binding in Live Board edit dropdown
  - Added Delete button HTML + event binding in History edit dropdown
  - Imported `deleteMovement` from datamodel, `getBookingById`/`updateBookingById` from bookingsStore

**Behaviour:**
- Confirmation: `"Delete strip <callsign> (#<id>)? This cannot be undone."`
- On confirm: clears `booking.linkedStripId` if linked, then removes movement from storage
- UI refreshes immediately; reload confirms permanent deletion
- Cancel action still works unchanged (marks as CANCELLED, preserves record)

**QA test log:**
- Delete unlinked strip: disappears from UI, gone after reload, no console errors
- Delete linked strip: booking's linkedStripId cleared, booking views unaffected
- Cancel button: still works as before (soft delete → History)

#### Task C — Fix Live Board traffic counter logic ✅

**Root cause:** `calculateDailyStats()` in `src/js/app.js` counted ALL movements for today including PLANNED and CANCELLED in the total. This violated requirements that:
- PLANNED should not affect counters (not yet real traffic)
- CANCELLED should not count in main movement totals
- Each movement counted exactly once

**Fix (files changed):**
- `src/js/app.js` — `calculateDailyStats()`:
  - Filters to only `ACTIVE` + `COMPLETED` status (excludes PLANNED and CANCELLED)
  - Deduplicates by movement ID (defensive)
  - Total computed from filtered+deduped set, not `todaysMovements.length`

**QA test log:**
- 1 PLANNED today: counter = 0 (correct, not counted)
- 1 ACTIVE today: counter = 1
- Mark ACTIVE → COMPLETED: counter still = 1 (same movement, not double-counted)
- Cancel a movement: counter decreases (CANCELLED excluded)
- View non-today history: today's counters unchanged

### 4.3 Known risks discovered during Sprint 2

- **Phantom time fields:** Movements edited via inline edit before this fix may have orphan `etd`/`atd`/`eta`/`ata`/`ect`/`act` properties. These are harmless (never read by display logic) but could be cleaned up in a future migration if desired.
- **Inline edit does not trigger all modal-level enrichments** (e.g. WTC lookup on type change, voice callsign update on callsign change). This is by design for minimal-risk patch semantics; full enrichment requires the Edit Details modal.

### 4.4 Sprint 3: Event storm safety audit + documentation hardening

**Sprint goal:** Prove no event-driven loops, redundant dispatch storms, or runaway re-renders exist under realistic stress. Document strip lifecycle semantics and counter rules.

**Merged to main:** 2026-02-10 (Europe/London)
- Merge method: merge commit (--no-ff)
- Commits: `c1bfee8`, `0c9e752`, `dd67acf`

#### Option A — Event / Refresh Storm Safety Audit ✅

**Approach:** Playwright-based stress test harness with test-only diagnostics instrumentation (`window.__FDMS_DIAGNOSTICS__` flag).

**Instrumentation added (files changed):**
- `src/js/ui_liveboard.js` — Counter increment in `renderLiveBoard()`, `renderHistoryBoard()`, `fdms:data-changed` listener
- `src/js/app.js` — Counter increment in `updateDailyStats()`, `updateFisCounters()`
- `src/js/services/bookingSync.js` — Counter increment in `_dispatchBookingPatch()` on dispatch

All counters gated behind `window.__FDMS_DIAGNOSTICS__ === true`. Zero overhead in normal operation.

**Test scenarios (all PASS):**

| Test ID | Scenario | Result | Key Metrics |
|---------|----------|--------|-------------|
| S1 | Rapid inline edits on one strip (N=25) | **PASS** | 25 renders for 25 edits (1:1 ratio) |
| S2 | Rapid edits across 10 strips (N=50) | **PASS** | 50 renders for 50 edits (1:1 ratio) |
| S3 | Status transitions + counter verification | **PASS** | Counters 0→3→3→2 (correct at each stage) |
| S4 | Booking-linked flow stress (N=15) | **PASS** | 15 sync dispatches, 15 received, link integrity maintained |
| S5 | Delete/cancel under load (10 strips) | **PASS** | 7 remaining, 4 counted (correct) |
| PERSIST | Post-stress persistence + consistency | **PASS** | Data survives reload, no duplicate IDs |
| QUIESCE | Counters quiesce after actions stop | **PASS** | 0 render growth in 3s idle window |

**Verdict:** No event storms, no infinite loops, no runaway re-renders. Render counts scale linearly with user actions (1:1 for inline edits, 1:1 for status transitions). Booking-linked edits show 2:1 render ratio (expected: edit render + fdms:data-changed render).

**Evidence:**
- Test harness: `sprint3_stress_verify.mjs`
- Evidence pack: `Sprint3_OptionA_StressAudit_EvidencePack_2026-02-09.md`
- Screenshots: `evidence_s3/*.png`

#### Option C — Documentation Hardening ✅

**Deliverable:** `docs/STRIP_LIFECYCLE_AND_COUNTERS.md`

Covers:
- Strip status definitions (PLANNED, ACTIVE, COMPLETED, CANCELLED, deleted)
- Status transition diagram with trigger descriptions
- Cancel vs Delete semantics
- Canonical time fields (`depPlanned`, `depActual`, `arrPlanned`, `arrActual`) with getter helper mapping
- Display logic per flight type
- Historical note on phantom time fields
- Counter rules: daily movement totals (EGOW), FIS counters, per-strip counters
- Counter update triggers and safety net (45s periodic tick)
- Booking link invariants (bidirectional pointers, sync pathways, reentrancy guard, reconciliation)
- Inline edit vs modal edit comparison
- Storage format reference
- Diagnostics mode reference

### 4.5 Sprint 4: Formations v1 end-to-end

**Sprint goal:** Implement user-facing create/edit/remove of `movement.formation` on a strip, Live Board badge `F×n`, expanded panel with inline element edits, WTC semantics, formation inheritance in duplicate flows, and a full Playwright regression suite.

**Merged:** 2026-02-10 (Europe/London) on branch `claude/fdms-formations-documentation-v5on5`

#### Deliverables

**Data model (`src/js/datamodel.js`):**
- `WTC_RANK` constant and `maxWtcString()` helper for WTC comparison
- `computeFormationWTC(elements)` — returns `{ wtcCurrent, wtcMax }` where current = max WTC across PLANNED+ACTIVE elements, max = max across all elements
- `normalizeFormation(formation)` — backward-compat repair called on every load; ensures `elements` is an array, fills missing fields, recomputes WTC; result saved back to localStorage
- `updateFormationElement(id, elementIndex, patch)` — patches a single element (status, depActual, arrActual), recomputes WTC, persists
- `ensureInitialised()` updated: runs `normalizeFormation` on any movement with a `formation` field; calls `saveToStorage()` if any formations were normalized

**UI (`src/js/ui_liveboard.js`):**
- Helper functions: `buildFormationElementRows`, `readFormationFromModal`, `wireFormationCountInput`
- `renderFormationDetails(m)` — expanded row subsection showing label, current/max WTC, per-element table with inline status select, dep/arr inputs, and Save button per row
- `renderLiveBoard()` — callsign cell now includes `<span class="badge badge-formation">F×n</span>` for strips with formations
- New Flight modal: collapsible Formation section (count input + dynamic element rows)
- Edit Details modal: collapsible Formation section (pre-populated from `m.formation`, with "Remove Formation" button)
- `js-save-flight`, `js-save-edit`, `js-save-complete-edit` handlers: read formation from modal and persist
- Duplicate modal: formation copy with elements reset to `status: "PLANNED"`, `depActual: ""`, `arrActual: ""`
- Event delegation for `.fmn-el-save` buttons: reads row values, calls `updateFormationElement`, re-renders, shows toast

**CSS (`src/css/vectair.css`):**
- `.fmn-el-input`, `.fmn-el-dep`, `.fmn-el-arr`, `.fmn-el-select` — inline element edit controls

**Documentation:**
- `docs/FORMATIONS.md` — 13-section canonical reference for the formation system

**Playwright regression (`sprint4_formation_verify.mjs`):**

| Test | Scenario | Result |
|------|----------|--------|
| F1 | No formation → badge absent | **PASS** |
| F2 | Create 2-element via UI → badge `F×2` persists after reload | **PASS** |
| F3 | Seeded 3-element → badge `F×3` on Live Board | **PASS** |
| F4 | Expanded panel: formation table + 3 Save buttons present | **PASS** |
| F5 | Element inline save: status=ACTIVE, depActual=13:20 persists | **PASS** |
| F6 | WTC recompute: EH10(M) completed → wtcCurrent=L, wtcMax=M | **PASS** |
| F7 | Edit modal pre-populates formation count=3 | **PASS** |
| F8 | Remove formation via edit modal → formation=null, badge gone | **PASS** |
| F9 | Duplicate inherits formation, elements reset to PLANNED/no actuals | **PASS** |
| F10 | Malformed formation `{ label: null }` normalized on load (no crash) | **PASS** |

**Result: 10/10 PASS, 0 JS errors**

**Evidence pack:**
- Screenshots: `evidence_s4/S4_*.png` (14 screenshots)
- Results JSON: `evidence_s4/sprint4_formation_results.json`
- Test harness: `sprint4_formation_verify.mjs`
- Linux kernel 4.4 workaround: `--single-process --no-zygote` Chromium flags
- CDN stub: `page.route('**/xlsx.full.min.js', ...)` to prevent network failures

#### Known issues discovered during Sprint 4

- **Linux kernel 4.4 Playwright click interception:** `click({ force: true })` on buttons inside `expand-section` still hits the covering element (coordinate-based). Fixed by using `dispatchEvent('click')` which directly fires the event on the target element.
- **normalizeFormation not persisted:** Initial implementation ran normalization in memory but skipped `saveToStorage()`. Fixed: `needsSave` flag triggers save when any formation is normalized.

### 4.6 Sprint 5: Formations v1.1 — element depAd/arrAd, editable callsign, validation, cascade, inheritance

**Sprint goal:** Extend formation elements with per-element Dep AD / Arr AD fields, editable callsigns, input validation (WTC + ICAO 4-char), formation element count guard (min 2, max 12), master status cascade (COMPLETED/CANCELLED), and produce-arrival inheritance. Write a 12-test Playwright regression suite.

**Merged:** 2026-02-11 (Europe/London) on branch `claude/fdms-formations-documentation-v5on5`

#### Deliverables

**Data model (`src/js/datamodel.js`):**
- `isValidWtcChar(wtc)` — true iff WTC ∈ {L, S, M, H, J}
- `isValidIcaoAd(ad)` — true iff ad is `""` or matches `/^[A-Z0-9]{4}$/`
- `isValidElementStatus(status)` — true iff status ∈ {PLANNED, ACTIVE, COMPLETED, CANCELLED}
- `normalizeFormation` updated: fills `element.depAd` and `element.arrAd` with `""` for legacy elements
- `cascadeFormationStatus(id, newStatus)` — exported; COMPLETED cascades PLANNED/ACTIVE→COMPLETED; CANCELLED cascades all→CANCELLED; recomputes WTC and persists

**UI (`src/js/ui_liveboard.js`):**
- `buildFormationElementRows` — new columns: Callsign (editable), Dep AD, Arr AD; clamped to [2, 12]; callsign defaults to `${base} ${n}` but is editable
- `readFormationFromModal` — reads callsign/depAd/arrAd; validates WTC and ICAO; returns `null` if formation section never opened (no rows rendered); returns `{ _error, message }` on validation failure; returns `null` if count < 2
- `wireFormationCountInput` — clamps to [2, 12]
- Callsign input listener in New Flight modal: only rebuilds rows if rows already exist (prevents phantom formation on normal saves)
- New Flight + Edit Details modal: `min=2 max=12` on count input
- `renderFormationDetails` — 10-column table: Status, Dep, Arr, Dep AD, Arr AD, Callsign, Reg, Type, WTC, Save; wrapped in scrollable `.formation-table-wrap`; empty depAd/arrAd shows master fallback in `.fmn-fallback` muted span
- `.fmn-el-save` delegation: reads depAd/arrAd per row, validates ICAO, patches element
- `transitionToCompleted` and `transitionToCancelled`: call `cascadeFormationStatus` after `updateMovement`
- `js-save-complete-edit` handler: calls `cascadeFormationStatus` after `updateMovement`
- `openReciprocalStripModal` (produce arrival/departure): copies formation with elements reset: `status="PLANNED"`, `depActual=""`, `arrActual=""`; recomputes WTC

**CSS (`src/css/vectair.css`):**
- `.formation-table-wrap` — `overflow-x: auto` for horizontal scroll on narrow screens
- `.fmn-el-ad` — 52px wide, `text-transform: uppercase`
- `.fmn-fallback` — 10px muted grey for inherited AD display
- `.fmn-ad-cell` — `min-width: 72px`

**Documentation:**
- `docs/FORMATIONS.md` — "Formations v1.1 — Clarifications and Extensions" section prepended; covers element schema v1.1, depAd/arrAd empty-value semantics, validation rules, element count rules, WTC semantics, cascade rules, produce inheritance, and out-of-scope items

**Playwright regression (`sprint5_formation_v11_verify.mjs`):**

| Test | Scenario | Result |
|------|----------|--------|
| G1 | depAd/arrAd/callsign inputs present in New Flight modal (count=2) | **PASS** |
| G2 | depAd/arrAd persist via New Flight modal save | **PASS** |
| G3 | depAd/arrAd editable in expanded panel; persists after `.fmn-el-save` | **PASS** |
| G4 | Empty depAd shows master fallback in `.fmn-fallback` | **PASS** |
| G5 | Invalid 3-char depAd rejected; element unchanged | **PASS** |
| G6 | Invalid WTC in New Flight modal blocks save; no movement created | **PASS** |
| G7 | Overridden element callsign persists after save | **PASS** |
| G8 | Formation count=1 → `movement.formation = null` | **PASS** |
| G9 | Master COMPLETE cascade → all PLANNED/ACTIVE elements become COMPLETED, wtcCurrent="" | **PASS** |
| G10 | Master CANCEL cascade → all elements become CANCELLED | **PASS** |
| G11 | Produce-arrival inherits formation + resets elements (status=PLANNED, actuals cleared, depAd copied) | **PASS** |
| G12 | Edit modal count input: `min=2 max=12` HTML attributes correct | **PASS** |

**Result: 12/12 PASS, 0 JS errors**

**Evidence pack:**
- Screenshots: `evidence_s5/S5_*.png` (12 screenshots)
- Results JSON: `evidence_s5/sprint5_formation_v11_results.json`
- Test harness: `sprint5_formation_v11_verify.mjs`

#### Bugs fixed during Sprint 5

- **Callsign input listener phantom formation:** When count input defaulted to 2 and user typed in `#newCallsignCode`, the callsign `input` listener triggered `buildFormationElementRows`, rendering element rows silently. Subsequent `readFormationFromModal` found those rows and created a formation even though the user never opened the formation section. Fixed: listener only rebuilds if `[data-el-callsign="0"]` already exists in container.
- **G10 dialog race:** Test registered `page.once('dialog', ...)` *after* clicking `.js-cancel`, so the `confirm()` dialog fired before the handler was attached (auto-dismissed as cancelled). Fixed: register handler *before* clicking.

#### Known limitations (v1.1 out-of-scope, deferred to v1.2+)

- Micro-strip fields (departure sheet per element) not implemented
- No server-side or multi-client sync (localStorage remains single-client)
- Formation cannot be added to a strip that is already COMPLETED or CANCELLED

### 4.7 Sprint 6: Formations v1.1 Parity — LOC (Local) strip creation

**Sprint goal:** Complete formation parity across all creation paths. The Local flight modal (`openNewLocalModal`) previously had `formation: null` hardcoded and lacked an authoring UI for formations. This sprint adds the collapsible Formation section to the LOC modal, wires all handlers (count input, callsign listener guard, expander toggle), and updates both save handlers (Save and Save & Complete) to read and persist formation data with cascade.

**Branch:** `claude/fdms-formations-documentation-v5on5`

#### Deliverables

**UI (`src/js/ui_liveboard.js`):**
- `openNewLocalModal` — collapsible Formation section added (HTML): `newLocFormationSection`, `newLocFormationCount`, `newLocFormationElementsContainer`; mirrors the DEP/ARR modal section
- LOC modal JS wiring: `wireFormationCountInput` for `newLocFormationCount`; callsign input listener with phantom-formation guard; `document.querySelectorAll('.modal-expander')` event binding (was missing from LOC modal — caused panel to stay hidden when clicked)
- `.js-save-loc` handler: reads `locFormation = readFormationFromModal(callsign, "newLocFormationCount", "newLocFormationElementsContainer")`; validation errors block save; `movement.formation = locFormation || null`
- `.js-save-complete-loc` handler: same formation read + validation; `formation: locCpFormation || null` in movement object; after `createMovement`, calls `cascadeFormationStatus(createdLoc.id, "COMPLETED")` if formation present

**Playwright regression (`sprint6_loc_formation_verify.mjs`):**

| Test | Scenario | Result |
|------|----------|--------|
| H1 | Formation created on LOC strip via New Local modal → badge F×2 appears | **PASS** |
| H2 | depAd/arrAd per element persist on LOC strip | **PASS** |
| H3 | Invalid WTC in LOC modal blocks save; no movement created | **PASS** |
| H4 | Invalid 3-char ICAO code in LOC modal blocks save | **PASS** |
| H5 | Formation section never opened → formation=null, no badge (phantom-formation guard) | **PASS** |
| H6 | Save-and-Complete LOC with formation → all elements cascade to COMPLETED | **PASS** |

**Result: 6/6 PASS, 0 JS errors**

Regressions: Sprint 4 10/10 PASS, Sprint 5 12/12 PASS (no regressions)

#### Bug fixed during Sprint 6

- **LOC modal expanders not wired:** The `openNewLocalModal` function did not include the `document.querySelectorAll('.modal-expander').forEach(...)` event binding that wires the collapsible section toggle. The Formation expander button had no click handler, so `panel.hidden` was never toggled and the Formation section remained permanently hidden. Fixed: added the same expander wiring block used in the DEP/ARR and Edit modals.

#### Dev tooling improvement (cross-platform Playwright imports)

- `package.json` added at repo root with `playwright@1.56.1` as a `devDependency` and `npm run test:s4/s5/s6` scripts.
- All three sprint verify scripts updated: replaced absolute-path imports (`/opt/node22/lib/node_modules/playwright/index.mjs`) with portable `import { chromium } from 'playwright'`.
- `package-lock.json` committed so `npm ci` is reproducible on Windows + Linux.
- `DEV-SETUP.md` updated with a "Regression Tests (developer QA tooling)" section documenting `npm ci`, `npx playwright install chromium`, and `npm run test:s*` commands.
- No changes under `src/`. No drift in delivery-model statements.

### 4.8 Sprint 7: LOC Standard Modal Parity

**Sprint goal:** Replace the bespoke LOC create/edit modal (`openNewLocalModal`) with the standard movement modal structure used by DEP/ARR/OVR. LOC now uses the same sectioned layout (IDENTITY, PLAN, TIMES, OPERATIONAL) and accordions (Remarks & Warnings, ATC Details, Formation), with LOC-specific locks applied to prevent user modification of Flight Type, Departure AD, and Arrival AD.

**Branch:** `claude/fdms-lite-ux-change-iepHR`

#### What changed

**`src/js/ui_liveboard.js`:**
- **`openNewLocalModal`** (bespoke form, removed from user flow): Replaced by `openNewLocFlightModal()`. The old bespoke function is no longer wired to any button and is now dead code. It has been removed from the codebase.
- **`openNewLocFlightModal()`** (new function): Renders the standard movement modal structure with:
  - Sections: IDENTITY, PLAN, TIMES, OPERATIONAL (matching `openNewFlightModal`)
  - Accordions: Remarks & Warnings, ATC Details, Formation
  - Two-column `modal-section-grid` layout
  - LOC locks: Flight Type = `<input value="LOC" disabled />` (not a select); Departure AD = `<input value="EGOW" disabled />`; Arrival AD = `<input value="EGOW" disabled />`
  - Backward-compatible element IDs (`newLocCallsignCode`, `newLocStart`, `newLocEnd`, `newLocFormationCount`, `newLocFormationSection`, `newLocFormationElementsContainer`, `.js-save-loc`, `.js-save-complete-loc`) to preserve Sprint 6 test compatibility
  - Added new fields not in bespoke form: Warnings textarea, ATC Details (Squawk, Route, Clearance), O/S count, FIS count, Priority checkbox/dropdown, Flight Rules dropdown
  - EGOW Code field present with datalist (same options as standard modal); validation only blocks save if a value is provided but is invalid (not enforced as mandatory, to preserve Sprint 6 backward compat)
  - Save handlers write depAd/arrAd = "EGOW" (hardcoded, user cannot override), flightType = "LOC", isLocal = true
  - Timing semantics unchanged: no ETD→ETA auto-fill in new modal (same as previous LOC behavior)
- **Button wire-up** (line ~4697): `safeOn(btnNewLoc, "click", openNewLocFlightModal)` (was `openNewLocalModal`)
- **`openEditMovementModal`**: Added `disabled` attribute to `editFlightType` select, `editDepAd` input, and `editArrAd` input when `flightType === "LOC"`, so editing an existing LOC movement also shows locked fields

**`package.json`:**
- Added `"test:s7": "node sprint7_loc_standard_modal_verify.mjs"` script

**`sprint7_loc_standard_modal_verify.mjs`** (new):
- 8-test Playwright regression suite (see table below)

**`evidence_s7/`** (new):
- 9 screenshots: `S7_1` through `S7_9`
- `sprint7_loc_standard_modal_results.json` with pass/fail summary + run metadata

#### Where

| Change | File | Key function / line |
|--------|------|---------------------|
| New LOC standard modal | `src/js/ui_liveboard.js` | `openNewLocFlightModal()` (new function replacing `openNewLocalModal`) |
| Button re-wire | `src/js/ui_liveboard.js` | `safeOn(btnNewLoc, "click", openNewLocFlightModal)` |
| Edit modal LOC locks | `src/js/ui_liveboard.js` | `openEditMovementModal()` — `disabled` on `editFlightType`, `editDepAd`, `editArrAd` for LOC |
| npm script | `package.json` | `"test:s7"` |
| Test harness | `sprint7_loc_standard_modal_verify.mjs` | — |

#### Why

LOC parity requirement: the bespoke LOC form had a single-column stacked layout lacking the standard sections, accordions, and two-column grid. Users saw a different UI for LOC vs DEP/ARR/OVR. This sprint routes LOC through a functionally equivalent form of the standard modal template, ensuring structural parity while preserving LOC-specific constraints (EGOW AD lock, LOC flight type lock) and all existing formation/timing semantics.

#### Playwright regression results

| Test | Scenario | Result |
|------|----------|--------|
| I1 | Standard modal structure: IDENTITY, PLAN, TIMES, OPERATIONAL headings present | **PASS** |
| I2 | Standard modal accordions: Remarks & Warnings, ATC Details, Formation | **PASS** |
| I3 | Flight Type shows LOC and is disabled/read-only | **PASS** |
| I4 | Departure AD shows EGOW and is disabled/read-only | **PASS** |
| I5 | Arrival AD shows EGOW and is disabled/read-only | **PASS** |
| I6 | LOC timing: entering ETD does not auto-fill ETA (unchanged behavior) | **PASS** |
| I7 | Save LOC; reload; depPlanned/arrPlanned/depAd/arrAd/flightType persisted correctly | **PASS** |
| I8 | Edit LOC: flight type locked to LOC, dep/arr AD locked to EGOW in edit modal | **PASS** |

**Result: 8/8 PASS, 0 JS errors**

Regressions: Sprint 4 10/10 PASS, Sprint 5 12/12 PASS, Sprint 6 6/6 PASS (no regressions)

#### Verification evidence (commands run)

```
npm run test:s7   → 8/8 PASS
npm run test:s4   → 10/10 PASS
npm run test:s5   → 12/12 PASS
npm run test:s6   → 6/6 PASS
```

All four suites passing on Linux kernel 4.4, Node v22, Playwright 1.56.1, Chromium headless.

- Test harness: `sprint7_loc_standard_modal_verify.mjs`

#### Deliverables checklist

- [x] LOC modal is the standard modal (sectioned layout), not the bespoke LOC form
- [x] LOC flight type locked to LOC (disabled input in new + edit modal)
- [x] LOC dep/arr AD locked to EGOW (disabled inputs in new + edit modal)
- [x] LOC timing semantics unchanged (no ETD→ETA auto-fill; same as before)
- [x] New Sprint 7 test: 8/8 PASS
- [x] Sprint 4: 10/10 PASS (no regression)
- [x] Sprint 5: 12/12 PASS (no regression)
- [x] Sprint 6: 6/6 PASS (no regression)
- [x] Evidence pack exists: `evidence_s7/`
- [x] STATE.md updated with audit entry

#### Notes

- Element IDs in the LOC modal (`newLocCallsignCode`, `newLocStart`, `newLocEnd`, formation IDs, `.js-save-loc`, `.js-save-complete-loc`) are preserved from the old bespoke modal to maintain backward compatibility with Sprint 6 regression tests.
- EGOW Code field is present and visible in the LOC modal (with datalist, same as standard modal). Validation blocks save only if an invalid code is entered, not if left empty — this preserves Sprint 6 test behavior where EGOW Code was not filled.
- No changes to counters, reporting logic, formation semantics, or delivery-model documentation.

## 5) Operating Procedure (Manager–Worker)

### 5.1 Before any new task ticket
- QA Lead (ChatGPT) reviews the latest `STATE.md` and frames the ticket in terms of:
  - invariants
  - acceptance criteria
  - evidence requirements

### 5.2 Requirements for Claude on every ticket
At end of work session, Claude must:
1) Update this `STATE.md`:
   - Mark newly completed items
   - Add/adjust technical debt entries
   - Set the next sprint objective
2) Provide an **Audit Summary + Evidence Pack** (file/function/selector level).

### 5.3 Source of truth rule
If a Claude summary conflicts with repository contents, the repo (zip/diff) wins; `STATE.md` must be corrected accordingly.
